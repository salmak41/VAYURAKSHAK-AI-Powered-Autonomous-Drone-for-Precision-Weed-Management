VAYURAKSHAK: AI-Powered Autonomous Drone for Precision Weed Management
Sowing the Future, Weeding with Precision

📌 Project Overview
VAYURAKSHAK is an autonomous quadcopter drone designed for precision weed management in agriculture. It uses artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision to detect, map, and spray weeds with high accuracy, significantly reducing herbicide usage and labor costs while promoting sustainable farming practices.

🎯 Problem Statement
Modern agriculture faces significant challenges in weed management:

Labor Intensity: Manual weeding requires 50–60 labor days per acre.

Inefficient Spraying: Traditional methods waste over 70% of herbicides.

Environmental Harm: Chemical runoff pollutes soil and water, and leads to herbicide-resistant weeds.

Accessibility Issues: Large machinery cannot operate in small, irregular, or water-logged fields.

💡 Our Solution
VAYURAKSHAK is an end-to-end autonomous system that:

Sees: Uses a high-resolution camera to scan the field.

Maps: AI identifies weeds and logs their GPS coordinates.

Sprays: Triggers micro-sprayers to apply herbicide only on detected weeds.

✨ Key Features
Precision Spraying: Reduces herbicide usage by 80–90%.

High Efficiency: Covers large areas 5x faster than manual labor.

Terrain Accessibility: Operates in any field condition.

Data Intelligence: Generates weed maps for future farm planning.

🛠️ System Architecture
The system consists of the following modules:

Field Monitoring: IoT camera/drone for image capture.

Navigation: GPS module for autonomous flight path planning.

Core Controller: Raspberry Pi 4/5 running TensorFlow Lite for real-time AI inference.

AI Vision: CNN-based weed vs. crop detection.

GPS Mapping: Logs weed coordinates and creates geotagged maps.

Action Command: Triggers spray mechanism.

Precision Spray: Uses solenoid valve nozzles for targeted micro-droplet spraying.

Data Analytics: Uploads weed maps to cloud/server for analytics and dashboards.

🔬 Technical Innovation
Edge-AI on Raspberry Pi: Real-time weed detection using TensorFlow Lite without internet dependency.

Custom Micro-Spraying Mechanism: Proprietary nozzle system for precise herbicide application.

Automated Geotagging & Mapping: Creates detailed weed location maps for future farm management.

End-to-End Automation: Autonomous takeoff, flight, processing, and spraying.

Cost-Effective Design: Affordable and accessible for small to medium farmers.
